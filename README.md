# Fauna GraphQL Guestbook Starter

This Guestbook Single-Page Application (SPA) example shows you how to use [Fauna's GraphQL endpoint](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/graphql/) in your Next.js project.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example):

## Why Fauna

By importing a `.gql` or `.graphql` schema into Fauna ([see our sample schema file](./schema.gql)), Fauna will generate required Indexes and GraphQL resolvers for you -- hands free üëê ([some limitations exist](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/graphql/#limitations)).

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```
npx create-next-app --example with-fauna with-fauna-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-fauna with-fauna-app
```

You can start with this template [using `create-next-app`](#using-create-next-app) or by [downloading the repository manually](#download-manually).

To use a live Fauna database, create a database at [dashboard.fauna.com](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) and generate an admin token by going to the **Security** tab on the left and then click **New Key**. Give the new key a name and select the 'Admin' Role. Copy the token since the setup script will ask for it. Do not use it in the frontend, it has superpowers which you don't want to give to your users.

### Setting Up Your Schema

The Next.js and Fauna example includes a setup script (`npm run setup`). After providing your admin token, the script will:

- **Import your GraphQL schema:** Fauna automatically sets up collections and indexes to support your queries. You can view these in your [project dashboard](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) under **GraphQL**.
- **Create an index and function:** The script will create a GraphQL resolver that uses [User-defined functions](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/graphql/functions?lang=javascript) based on a sorting index.
- **Create a scoped token:** This token is for use on the client side. The admin key can be used on the server side.

After the script completes, a `.env.local` [file](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) will be created for you with the newly generated client token assigned to an Environment Variable.

### Run locally

Install packages, set up if needed, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
